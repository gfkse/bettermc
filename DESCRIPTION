Description: Drop-in replacement for parallel::mclapply adding e.g. tracebacks, 
    crash dumps, condition handling, progress bars and faster inter process 
    communication. Some of the internal functions are also exported for other
    use: etry (extended try), copy2shm/allocate_from_shm (copy to and allocate 
    from POSIX shared memory) and char_map/map2char (split a character vector
    into its unique elements and a mapping on these).
