Description: Drop-in replacement for 'parallel::mclapply()' adding e.g.
    tracebacks, crash dumps, retries, condition handling, improved seeding,
    progress bars and faster inter process communication. Some of the internal
    functions are also exported for other use: 'etry()' (extended try),
    'copy2shm()/allocate_from_shm()' (copy to and allocate from POSIX shared
    memory), 'char_map/map2char()' (split a character vector into its unique
    elements and a mapping on these) and various semaphore related functions.
